The final section of the course places these considerations in transnational perspective, examining such themes as competition and restructuring in the global information industries, the uneven emergence of global information policy regimes, and the strategic adoption of information technology in international development settings.

An online interaction environment is an electronic forum, accessed through computers or other electronic devices, in which community members can conduct some or all of their interactions. We will use the term eCommunity as shorthand, both for communities that conduct all of their interactions online and for communities that use online interaction to supplement face-to-face interactions. There will be two main treads that weave through the course, based on the two main texts. One tread will be concerned with the practical issues of design and use of online tools to support communities, and how choices that must be made in design can impact the function and style of the resulting community. The second thread will focus on the sociological theory that provides a frame to better understand communities in general. These theoretical pieces will provide a lens for better understanding the implications of choices made on the more practical level.","syllabus":"http:\/\/www.si.umich.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/SI529_syllabus_W13.pdf","units":"3","type":"Lecture","course_catelog":"SI","term_info":{"3":2,"4":16,"5":2,"6":23,"8":1},"term_total":44,"alumni":[395,20,159,265,727,767,809,837,910,914,1009,677,1031,40,97,578,602,662,731,735,748,889,948,1079,150,151,306,436,713,1025,1186,270,347,916,759],"alumni_count":35},{"course_id":22,"course_title":"Principles in Management","course_number":"530","course_description":"This course provides a foundation in management for information professionals interested in working in for-profit or non-profit organizations.

We discuss automatic calculation from the abacus to the integrated circuit; logic machines from Boole to neural networks; and the evolution of programming languages from assemblers to Ada. Our primary focus is the social, political, and cultural contexts of post-1939 digital computers and computer networks. We explore such topics as: A design for a stem-powered, mechanical computer in Victorian England. How early computers cracked the Nazi Enigma cipher during the World War II. How the Cold War changed computers -- and how computers changed the Cold War. Why digital computing replaced well-developed analog methods in the 1940s and 1950s. Computing in Europe, the Soviet Union, and the developing world. How hackers helped shape minicomputers and the Internet. How amateur hobbyists invented the personal computer. The story behind the World Wide Web. This course makes the argument that new technologies and their social effects evolve together along a variety of dimensions. Some of these are technical: innovation, design, and opportunity. Some are social: funding sources, societal values, and organizational structures. Still others are macro-scale economic, political, and social forces. The major questions that motivate our study of computers will concern \"why\" issues. Why were computers invented? Who wanted them, and for what purpose? How have computers changed the shape of society and culture -- and how did society and culture shape them? The course is relevant to anyone interested in the history, politics, and culture of technology.","syllabus":"http:\/\/www.si.umich.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/589syll.pdf","units":"3","type":"Lecture","course_catelog":"SI","term_info":{"6":1},"term_total":1,"alumni":[662],"alumni_count":1},{"course_id":53,"course_title":"Data Manipulation","course_number":"601","course_description":"This course aims to help students get started with their own data harvesting, processing, and aggregation.

Thus, even when incentives are \"aligned\" with overall system goals, there are many instances where we make poor choices because as human beings, we are all susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of unwanted and unintended outcomes and decisions. Our errors are what make us human, but up until now, they have been largely ignored by systems designers, whether these designers make complex public policy, manage a team or design an information system. But knowing how people think, we can become choice architects who design environments that both yield better decision making on the part of users, and achieve behavior that is consistent with overall system goals while gaining a competitive design-edge. The first goal of this course is to inform future information system professionals, designers and managers about human decision rules and their associated biases so that these insights can be incorporated into their design, business or management strategies. Knowledge of these issues can be a significant source of competitive advantage because they are unknown to most information systems professionals and they are not taught in most I-schools. The second goal of this course is to clarify how these results can be leveraged to create original and more effective systems and institutions that meet the designer's goals.","syllabus":"http:\/\/www.si.umich.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/SI617_syllabus_W13.pdf","units":"3","type":"Lecture","course_catelog":"SI","term_info":{"1":8,"3":1,"6":12},"term_total":21,"alumni":[361,203,133,1007,1173,151,578,662,674,748,905,948,1167,66,191,362,631,950,1197,811,833,1193],"alumni_count":22},{"course_id":60,"course_title":"Exploratory Data Analysis","course_number":"618","course_description":"This course aims to help students get started with their own data acquisition and analysis.

The responsibility is \"first\" because appraisal comes first in the sequence of archival functions and thus influences all subsequent archival activities, and its \"first\" in importance because appraisal determines what tiny silver of the total human documentary production will actually become \"archives\" and thus part of society's collective memory. The archivist is thereby actively shaping the future's history of our own times. This course begins with the theoretical foundations of appraisal and the controversial responsibility of assigning cultural value to some documentary artifacts and not others, within a broader context of history and memory. Sessions on the evolution of appraisal thinking, and different appraisal experiences, in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia, follow. With this background, the course will focus on examples from the real world of appraisal strategy and methodology, including electronic records. Attention will be paid to personal and private records as well as government and institutional ones. The class will end by trying to apply the theories and methodologies through group projects to various recording media and functional areas of records creation, these reflecting student interests. The goal of the course is to provide students through readings and discussion with a thorough knowledge of the basic theories, strategies, and professional practices concerning appraisal and an orientation to doing this job well as working archivists.","syllabus":"http:\/\/www.si.umich.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/SI632_syllabus_W13.pdf","units":"3","type":"Lecture","course_catelog":"SI","term_info":{"1":1,"2":1,"3":11,"4":84,"5":2,"6":46,"8":3},"term_total":148,"alumni":[445,447,915,913,719,323,894,874,62,205,332,418,816,859,881,1014,1090,216,119,194,227,252,337,379,527,752,1015,697,1100,145,207,275,446,822,54,58,111,124,277,355,643,698,845,852,867,921,982,1041,1105,1231,1236,433,167,195,224,267,364,391,416,427,497,530,645,647,651,670,876,936,969,1069,1076,1104,1115,1121,1149,1179,1222,1237,988,221,957,1178,700,31,144,154,258,260,293,507,718,779,787,808,970,1010,1064,1141,1164,495,834,1196,1224,1053,985,81,402,444,1058,1117,236,250,55,615,682,294],"alumni_count":116},{"course_id":73,"course_title":"History of Books and Print","course_number":"633","course_description":"This course addresses a number of fundamental questions in European cultural history centered on the book as both material as well as cultural and social object.

Building a search engine involves a lot more than indexing some documents -- information retrieval is the study of the interaction between users and large information environments. It covers concepts such as information need, documents and queries, indexing and searching, retrieval evaluation, multimedia and hypertext search, Web search, as well as bibliographical databases. In this course, students go over some classic concepts of information retrieval and then quickly jump to the current state of the art in the field, where crawlers, spiders, and hard-of-hearing personal butlers roam.","syllabus":"http:\/\/www.si.umich.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/SI650_syllabus_W13.pdf","units":"3","type":"Lecture","course_catelog":"SI","term_info":{"1":1,"2":1,"3":2,"4":12,"6":6},"term_total":22,"alumni":[934,222,473,1056,558,151,335,506,674,713,905,1176,1218,306,707,819,703,627,631,88,833,93,304,601,1062],"alumni_count":25},{"course_id":89,"course_title":"Physical Treatment Processes for Preservation Administrators","course_number":"651","course_description":"This course introduces students to the artifactual nature of books and papers, and associated concepts of permanence and deterioration, provides an overview of the principles of the conservation of paper-based materials, and discusses the application of those principles to developing preservation policy and working with professional conservators.

Automatic, robust, and intelligent data mining techniques have become essential tools to handle heterogeneous, noisy, nontraditional, and large-scale data sets. This is a doctoral seminar course of advanced topics in data mining. The course provides an overview of recent research topics in the field of data mining, the state-of-the-art methods to analyze different genres of information, and the applications to many real world problems. The course will highlight the practical applications of data mining instead of the theoretical foundations of machine learning and statistical computing. The course materials will focus on how the information in different real world problems can be represented as particular genres, or formats of data, and how the basic mining tasks of each genre of data can be accomplished using the state-of-the-art techniques. To this end, the course is not only suitable for doctoral students who are doing research in data mining related fields, but also for those who are consumers of data mining techniques in their own disciplines, such as natural language processing, network science, human computer interaction, economics, social computing, sociology, business intelligence, and biomedical informatics, etc.","syllabus":"NULL","units":"3","type":"Seminar","course_catelog":"SI","term_info":{"11":1},"term_total":1,"alumni":[259],"alumni_count":1},{"course_id":114,"course_title":"Qualitative Methods","course_number":"724","course_description":"The purpose of this seminar is to examine, critique current research employing, and begin to utilize a variety of qualitative methods.
